          A passionate indie developer and the mind behind this perfume experience. 
          This project isnâ€™t just code â€” itâ€™s a dream built through late nights, 
          self-doubt, courage, and endless cups of chai.

        <p>
          I come from a place where dreams feel too expensive, and building a full-stack perfume marketplace
          seemed impossible. But I chose to believe â€” in hard work, in myself, and in the power of fragrance
          to trigger emotion and memory.
        </p>
        <p>
          I taught myself code, piece by piece. Faced bugs that made me cry, deadlines that felt endless,
          and resources I couldnâ€™t afford. But with each error, I got better. I pushed through. I built this.
        </p>
        <p>
          Today, what you see is more than a store. Itâ€™s proof that passion, consistency, and grit can turn
          an idea into a living experience. One click, one scent, one dream at a time.

        <h2 className="text-3xl font-semibold">Why Perfume? ðŸŒ¸</h2>
        <p>
          Perfume is not just fragrance â€” itâ€™s identity. Itâ€™s confidence in a bottle. 
          Itâ€™s nostalgia. That one scent that reminds you of someone special, a festival, a rainy day.
        </p>
        <p>
          I wanted to create a place where people could discover that â€” not just products, 
          but their *signature*. A reflection of who they are.

        <p>
          Iâ€™m constantly learning, improving, and dreaming bigger. This is just the beginning. 
          Expect more features, better experiences, and maybe â€” your own custom fragrance finder. ðŸ˜‰
